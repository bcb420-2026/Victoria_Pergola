create a 5 by 10 matrix of random integers
```{r}
set.seed(67)

counts <- matrix(
  sample(1:100, size = 5 * 10, replace = TRUE),
  nrow = 5,
  ncol = 10
)
```

define column names as cond1, cond2, cond3, cond4, cond5, ctrl1, ctrl2, ctrl3, ctrl4, ctrl5
```{r}
colnames(counts) <- c(
  paste0("cond", 1:5),
  paste0("ctrl", 1:5)
)
```

define row names as gene1, gene2, gene3 ...
```{r}
rownames(counts) <- paste0("gene", 1:5)
```

View the current matrix
```{r}
counts
```

Compute the fold change for each gene.
```{r}
# get mean expression for each (cond and ctrl)
cond_mean <- rowMeans(counts[, 1:5])
ctrl_mean <- rowMeans(counts[, 6:10])

# calculate fold change
fold_change <- cond_mean / ctrl_mean


# combine results into a df
results <- data.frame(
  gene = rownames(counts),
  cond_mean = cond_mean,
  ctrl_mean = ctrl_mean,
  fold_change = fold_change
)

results
```
