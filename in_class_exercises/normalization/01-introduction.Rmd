# What is normalization?

Normalization adjusts raw measurements so that samples become comparable by removing **unwanted technical effects** while preserving **true biological signal**.

In sequencing-based expression data, raw counts reflect both:

- the amount of RNA (biology)
- sequencing depth, composition, gene length, etc. (technology)

Normalization is one of the first steps in any analysis pipeline and can substantially affect downstream results.
