# Technical vs biological variation

## Technical variation

Examples:

- different sequencing depths (library sizes)
- batch effects (day, reagent, operator)
- gene length and GC content biases

We aim to control/correct these.

## Biological variation

Differences due to the biology we care about:

- condition, tissue, genotype
- treatment, disease status

Normalization should reduce technical variation while leaving biological variation intact.
